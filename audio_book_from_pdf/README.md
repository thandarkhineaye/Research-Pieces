# Making Audio Book from PDF
Learning to convert any regular PDF into an Audiobook using Python.
I used VScode as Python IDE.
Open VSCode and create a project titled as "Audio_book_from_PDF". 
Then, open the terminal and type the below-listed commands to install the respective libraries.
```
pip install pyttsx3
pip install PyPDF2
```
Run the main.py
Choose PDF file location
Wait till recording finish because that's gonna be take time to finish according to amount of sentences.
